- A **histogram** of batch-level processing times (`processing_days`).  
- The **x-axis** shows how many days each batch took to complete.  
- The **y-axis** shows the number of batches falling in each time range.  
- The **red dashed line at 2 days** marks the **delay threshold**.  

# Insights you can derive
1. **Most batches are fast**  
   - The bulk of batches finish within **0–2 days**, clustering left of the threshold line.  
   - This indicates the process is generally efficient for a majority of runs.  

2. **Significant delayed tail**  
   - There is a **long tail to the right**, with some batches taking much longer (5–10+ days, even beyond 20 days).  
   - These extended outliers suggest **specific bottlenecks or exceptional cases** that require deeper investigation.  

3. **Delay threshold exceedances** 
   - A notable number of batches cross the **2-day delay threshold**, visible as bars to the right of the red line.  
   - These represent the **share of batches at risk** for customer service or operational performance metrics.  

4. **Operational variability**  
   - The spread of the distribution shows that while most processes are tightly controlled, there’s **variability across certain batches**.  
   - Identifying root causes (equipment issues, material shortages, product type differences) can reduce this variability.

1. **Overall variability across months**
   - Most lines operate **close to or below 2 days** in many months, but several spikes occur periodically.  
   - Indicates **occasional bottlenecks** rather than consistent systemic delays.  

2. **Severe outliers**
   - Some months show extreme peaks:
     - One line (possibly **Line 24**) spiked above **30 days**.  
     - Another spike around **20 days** occurred in a different line (likely Line 25 or 13).  
   - These peaks dominate the delay pattern and should be investigated.  

3. **Recent upward trend**
   - Toward later months, several lines (e.g., **Line 1, Line 2, Line 13**) are **consistently above 2 days**.  
   - Suggests a **gradual worsening trend** across multiple lines.  

4. **Stable performers**

   - These represent **best practices** and process stability.  

# Insights & recommendations
- **Investigate spikes (Line 24 & 25):**
  - Likely due to **major disruptions** (machine breakdowns, manpower shortage, or large complex batches).  
  - Need root-cause analysis for those extreme delays.  

- **Monitor emerging trends (Lines 1, 2, 13):**
  - Gradual creep above threshold signals **capacity stress**.  
  - Address before they become chronic bottlenecks.  

- **Learn from stable lines (6, 7, 15, 18):**
  - Capture **process discipline, scheduling, or resource allocation strategies** keeping them below threshold.  
  - Use as benchmarks.  

- **Consider rolling average visualization:**
  - A **3-month rolling average** would smooth out extreme spikes and reveal more stable trends.

# Insights & recommendations
- **Prioritize improvement efforts on Lines 1–10**  
  - They are responsible for the majority of delays and will give the **biggest impact if optimized**.  
  - Possible issues: capacity overload, frequent breakdowns, scheduling inefficiencies.  

- **Focus secondary attention on Lines 11–19**  
  - Moderate level of delays, worth monitoring and addressing after the top 10 lines are stabilized.  

- **Study best practices from Lines 23–25**  
  - Very low or zero delays → investigate **why they are so efficient** (lower workload, better resource management, or less complex products?).  
  - Apply learnings to high-delay lines.

- **80/20 rule applies**: The top 10 lines (1–10) are likely contributing to **over 70% of total delays**.  
- Improvements in these critical lines can drastically reduce system-wide production delays.

# Key observations
1. **High-workload lines (1–10)**

   - Despite high volumes, a **large chunk (blue) is delayed**.

3. **Low-workload lines (20–25)**

   - Some still show delays (e.g., line 20), while others (23–25) are mostly delay-free.

  - Improving efficiency here will have the **greatest system-wide impact**.  

- **Balanced focus on throughput and quality**

# Conclusion
- The system follows a **Pareto distribution**: the top 10 lines account for most production and most delays.  
- Optimizing these lines would yield the largest benefit.  
- However, since delays also exist in medium/low-volume lines, **root cause analysis should go beyond workload** and check operational practices, resource constraints, and product complexity.

        # What this chart shows
- The chart compares the **average scrap factor per production line**.  
- Scrap factor indicates the proportion of material wasted (scrap) during production.  
- Each bar corresponds to a **Line No**, with its respective average scrap factor.

# Key observations
1. **Most lines are clustered around ~0.03 (3%) scrap factor**  
   - This indicates a relatively consistent performance across the majority of lines.  

2. **Line 1 shows the lowest scrap factor (~0.018 / 1.8%)**  
   - This suggests Line 1 is operating more efficiently, with less material waste compared to others.  
   - Could be due to better machine calibration, newer equipment, or skilled operators.  

3. **Lines 2, 13, 21, and 23 show slightly lower scrap rates (~2.5–2.8%)** compared to the ~3% benchmark.  
   - These may be secondary efficient performers.  

4. **No line shows excessively high scrap rates** (all are within a narrow range around 3%).  
   - This suggests scrap is a systemic baseline issue rather than isolated to one problematic line.  

# Insights & recommendations
- **Benchmark Line 1 practices**  
  - Investigate why Line 1 has significantly lower scrap.  
  - Replicate best practices (e.g., preventive maintenance, operator skill, material handling) across other lines.  

- **Focus on small improvements across all lines**  
  - Since most lines are near 3%, a **0.5% reduction plant-wide** could yield significant savings in material costs.  

- **Check for systemic causes**  
  - The uniformity of scrap factors indicates a **common process or formula-driven scrap rate**, rather than line-specific defects.  
  - This means looking into **recipe design, raw material variability, or production setup standards** might be more impactful.  

# Conclusion
- Scrap rates are generally stable but consistently around ~3%.  
- Line 1 stands out as a model of efficiency (~40% lower scrap vs. average).  
- By studying Line 1’s practices and applying them plant-wide, overall scrap can be reduced significantly

# ⏱️ Monthly Delay Rate (%) – Analysis

### What the chart shows
- This line chart tracks the **delay rate (%) by month**.  
- The dashed gray line at 50% is a **reference threshold** for acceptable delay levels.  
- Red markers highlight the actual monthly delay performance.  

---

### 🔑 Key Observations
1. **Extremely high volatility**  
   - Delay rates fluctuate sharply month-to-month, often swinging from near zero to over **1000%+**.  
   - Indicates unstable processes or external disruptions.

2. **Early period (left side)**  
   - Several **spikes above 1200% delay rate**, followed by a gradual decline.  
   - Suggests initial instability before some corrective measures.  

3. **Mid-period (center of the chart)**  
   - Delay rates are relatively **low and stable**, often hovering near or below the 50% threshold.  
   - This was the **best performing phase**.  

4. **Recent period (right side)**  
   - Sustained **high delays (800%–1500%)** with sharp month-to-month swings.  
   - Suggests recurrence of systemic problems, possibly capacity constraints, supply chain issues, or workforce inefficiencies.  

---

### 💡 Insights & Recommendations
- **Investigate root causes of spikes**  
  - Look into months with extreme delays (>1000%). These may align with **material shortages, machine breakdowns, or peak demand surges**.  

- **Replicate mid-period stability**  
  - The stable months (near/below 50%) should be studied as benchmarks — what processes worked then that are missing now?  

- **Recent performance is concerning**  
  - Sustained high delays suggest **systemic inefficiencies have returned**.  
  - Requires urgent corrective action to avoid recurring customer dissatisfaction and financial losses.  

- **Forecasting & resource planning**  
  - Volatility suggests delays may not be random. Using **seasonality analysis** could help anticipate spikes and plan resources accordingly.

    # 🚨 Delay Reasons by Line – Analysis

### What the chart shows
- This stacked bar chart shows **delayed batch counts per line**, broken down by different **delay reasons**.  
- The legend categorizes causes:  
  - **Major:** Addition/deletion for Batch WIP, Capacity Constraints, RM Short, ERP/WIP Errors.  
  - **Minor but recurring:** CR.LOW, HOLD BY SC, Holidays, Supply Chain instructions, Viscosity Variation.  

---

### 🔑 Key Observations
1. **Line 1 is the biggest bottleneck**  
   - Extremely high delays (~850+ counts), far above all other lines.  
   - Mostly driven by **“Addition and deletion for Batch WIP”**.  

2. **Lines 2–11 have consistent but moderate delays**  
   - Each shows **~250–300 delayed batches**, again dominated by Batch WIP changes.  
   - Secondary reasons (capacity constraints, RM short, ERP/WIP error) are present but comparatively minor.  

3. **Lines 12–14 are nearly clean**  
   - Very few delays logged, suggesting either **lower load or more efficient processes**.  

4. **Root cause dominance**  
   - Across all lines, **Batch WIP adjustments** are the overwhelming root cause.  
   - Other categories (capacity, raw material shortage, ERP/WIP error) remain small contributors.  

---

### 💡 Insights & Recommendations
- **Immediate focus: Line 1**  
  - Investigate **Batch WIP process design** – why does Line 1 face disproportionate rework?  
  - Possible causes: scheduling conflicts, incorrect batch planning, operator interventions.  

- **Standardize WIP handling across lines**  
  - Since Batch WIP is the dominant reason everywhere, a **cross-line process correction** could reduce delays significantly.  

- **Preventive measures for secondary causes**  
  - Build stronger **capacity buffers** (machine/operator availability).  
  - Strengthen **raw material planning** to reduce RM shortages.  
  - Audit **ERP/WIP data accuracy** to minimize system-driven delays.  

- **Learn from Lines 12–14**  
  - Study practices here (lower volumes? better planning? different operators?) and replicate to Lines 1–11.
